# bankchrun
This project predicts bank customer churn using machine learning. After data cleaning and encoding, multiple models were evaluated and a regularized Decision Tree was selected for stable, interpretable performance (90–94%). The model is validated with accuracy and ROC–AUC and supports probability-based predictions for deployment.
